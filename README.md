Dynamic programming exercises from CodeCamp in YouTube: https://youtu.be/oBt53YbR9Kk.

## CanSum, HowSum and BestSum notes
CanSum: "Can you do it? yes/no"
HowSum: "How will you do it?"
BestSum: "What is the optimize way to do it?"

CanSum: Decision problem
HowSum: Combinatorial problem
BestSum: Optimization problem

## Conclusion
- Notice any overlapping subproblems
- Decide what is the trivially smallest input
- Think recursively to use Memoization
- Think iteratively to use Tabulation
- Draw a strategy first!
