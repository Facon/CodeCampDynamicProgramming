Dynamic programming exercises from CodeCamp in YouTube: https://youtu.be/oBt53YbR9Kk.

## CanSum, HowSum and BestSum notes
* CanSum: "Can you do it? yes/no"
* HowSum: "How will you do it?"
* BestSum: "What is the optimize way to do it?"

* CanSum: Decision problem
* HowSum: Combinatoric problem
* BestSum: Optimization problem

## CanConstruct, CountConstruct and AllConstruct notes
* CanConstruct: "Can you do it? yes/no"
* CountConstruct: "In how many ways will you do it?"
* AllConstruct: "What are all the possible ways to do it?"

* CanSum: Decision problem
* HowSum: Combinatoric enumeration problem
* AllConstruct: Combinatoric construction problem

## Conclusion
- Notice any overlapping subproblems
- Decide what is the trivially smallest input
- Think recursively to use Memoization
- Think iteratively to use Tabulation
- Draw a strategy first!
